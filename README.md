# Capstone Project Module 2
## NYC TLC Trip Record Data
### By : Zahra Rizkita Putri

# Problem Identification
The problem of insufficient taxi distribution in certain areas refers to the uneven availability of taxis across different locations in New York City. It means that some areas have a scarcity of taxis, leading to limited access to reliable transportation services for residents and visitors.

# Stakeholder
The stakeholder is the COO of NYC TLC Company

# Data Cleaning
- Dropping columns that has no value
- Dropping passanger count, trip distance, and fare amount that has value of 0

# Data Anaysis
1. Analysis 1 : Distribution of Trips Based on Borough
2. Analysis 2 : Distribution of Trips Based on Zone
3. Analysis 3 : Number of Trips by Borough and Pickup Zone
4. Analysis 4 : Top 15 Routes of NYC TLC Trips
5. Analysis 5 : Frequency of Trip per Day and per Hour
6. Analysis 6 : Fare Amount Analysis Based on Route

# Conclusions
1. From the distribution of trips based on borough and zone, it can be observed that the number of taxi trips in New York City is not evenly distributed. There is a significant difference in the number of trips between the highest and lowest zones and boroughs.
2. It can be inferred that East Harlem (North and South) are popular pick-up locations, as most taxi drivers tend to accumulate in those zones. However, there are still other routes with different pick-up locations that have a relatively small number of trips.
3. Taxis are used as a transportation mode throughout the day. The number of trips shows a significant increase from early morning until after work hours, and then gradually decreases until midnight.
4. The analysis reveals that there are instances where the fare amount of taxi trips does not correspond proportionally to the trip distance. Both values should ideally be proportional to each other.

# Recommendations
1. Improve taxi distribution: To address the uneven distribution of taxi trips, it is recommended to allocate resources and incentives to encourage taxi drivers to operate in areas with low taxi availability. This can be achieved through targeted initiatives, such as providing financial incentives or offering additional benefits for serving under-served areas.
2. Enhance availability in other routes: While East Harlem (North and South) are popular pick-up locations, efforts should be made to improve taxi availability in other routes with low trip numbers. This can be accomplished by promoting those routes among taxi drivers, providing real-time data on demand and passenger trends, and incentivizing drivers to serve those areas.
3. Adjust taxi supply throughout the day: Since taxis are used as a transportation mode throughout the day, it is important to adjust the taxi supply based on the varying demand patterns. This can involve monitoring and analyzing the demand trends in different time periods and deploying taxis accordingly to ensure an adequate supply during peak hours and optimize resources during off-peak periods.
4. Ensure fare-distance proportionality: To address the issue of fare amount not being proportional to the trip distance, it is recommended to review and revise the fare structure to ensure a fair and accurate representation of the distance traveled. This can involve conducting periodic evaluations of fare calculations and considering adjustments based on factors such as fuel costs, operational expenses, and market dynamics.

By implementing these recommendations, it is possible to improve taxi availability, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize the overall efficiency of the taxi transportation system in New York City.
